Exercises
10.1-1
Using Figure 10.1 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence
PUSH(S, 4), PUSH(S, 1), PUSH(S, 3), POP(S), PUSH(S, 8), and POP(S) on an
initially empty stack S stored in array S[1 . . 6].
10.1-2
Explain how to implement two stacks in one array A[1 . . n] in such a way that
neither stack overflows unless the total number of elements in both stacks together
is n. The PUSH and POP operations should run in O(1) time.
10.1-3
Using Figure 10.2 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the
sequence ENQUEUE(Q, 4), ENQUEUE(Q, 1), ENQUEUE(Q, 3), DEQUEUE(Q),
ENQUEUE(Q, 8), and DEQUEUE(Q) on an initially empty queue Q stored in array
Q[1 . . 6].
10.1-4
Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect underflow and overflow of a queue.

10.1-5
Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end, and a
queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a deque (doubleended
queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four O(1)-time
procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque
constructed from an array.
10.1-6
Show how to implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze the running time of the
queue operations.
10.1-7
Show how to implement a stack using two queues. Analyze the running time of the
stack operations.
